# bookshelf-permissions

## Description

This module is a plugin for [Bookshelf.js](https://github.com/tgriesser/bookshelf), to control CRUD access to Bookshelf models and collections based on permissions.

It integrates well with [bookshelf-advanced-serialization](https://github.com/sequiturs/bookshelf-advanced-serialization).

## Roadmap

This plugin is still in development and APIs are subject to change. Unit tests and better documentation are planned for a v1.0.0 release. This plugin is currently used in production by [Sequiturs](https://sequiturs.com), however, and its functionality is tested thoroughly via integration testing of the Sequiturs application.
